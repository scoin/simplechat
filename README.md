simplechat
==========
Node, Express and Mongo sandbox. Right now it is a really simple chat app using ajax for updating the page and posting messages to the database.

This is basically complete, except for limiting the size of the mongo collection and using polling instead of ajax calls on an interval.

This was a good exercise but now I will be moving on to Socket.IO and implementing something more robust.
